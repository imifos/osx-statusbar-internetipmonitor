# OSX Statusbar Internet IP Monitor

OSX Status Bar Widget displaying your external "Internet" IP address as seen by web pages. Using the menu, the IP can be classified as GOOD or BAD. The display changes accordingly.

The tool pings an external server regularly asking for the IP it sees. Nothing complicated here. :)

I use it to have a permanent display of me being on a VPN or not.

Currently, the tool is very simple and basic, but works well. IIt's planned to add some more features (label IPs, select server and interval) and an installer, as it might be useful for other to use it as well.

An "versionless" version of the executable can be found in the Releases tab.
